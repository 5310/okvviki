okvviki
=======

    This project is under construction.

**okvviki** is a simple hyperlinked note-taking toy that uses OpenKeyval for storage. 

(I would like it if you pronounce it "okay-wiki" and make the 'w' sound more like a 'v'. But eh...)

It is not a "real" app, but rather an experiment to see how easily I can make a simple wiki-like application for spontaneous anonymous shared note-taking.
